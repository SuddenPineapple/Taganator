# Taganator
A list of websites that fit under cerntain types. The idea is to use this list so that a search engine can blacklist or whitelist certain types of info by request of the user

The patent or trademark or copyright is owned by some other person or entity or it may not have a patent or trademark or copyright. Please contact the owner of the website you may have in question for more info.

to put a site into the list put it in alpahabetical order with the https://www part removed then put a space then the { character then 
put the tags in that are listed below that apply to the site with a comma and no space seperating them.
